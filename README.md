# Formal models of hardware peripherals
Our aim has been to build and verify SMV models of hardware peripherals with use of the model checker NuSMV to check security properties and a liveness property. We created a formal model of the universal asynchronous transmitter/receiver (UART), a DMA model and a model of the main memory (RAM).
